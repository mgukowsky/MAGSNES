#MAGSNES
Native NES and SNES emulator for Windows, written in C++

#About
This is a personal passion project of mine which aims to accurately emulate the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) and Super Nintendo Entertainment System (SNES) video game consoles with minimal overhead. While still a WIP, in its current state the emulator can play many classic NES ROMs in iNES (*.nes) format. Feel free to browse the source for an idea of how the program works!
